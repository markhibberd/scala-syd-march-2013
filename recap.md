# Laws
## Let us reason about code and
## produce higher-level libraries

# Equational Reasoning
## Gives us Leverage for easy refactoring

# Data Types
## let us build composable abstractions
## for dealing with complex problems

--

## Stacking these abstractions together gives us a
# rich
# controlled
## programming model
