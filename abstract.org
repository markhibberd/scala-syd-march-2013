* Patterns in Types: Reader, Writer, State in Scala

Developers are often very good at spotting repetition in their
programs at the value level, but for some reason struggle, or are
reluctant to, apply that same careful analysis at the type level.

This talk aims to build up an intuition for spotting _when_ you can
factor your types, examining _what_ this gains you, and looking at the
_practicalities_ for doing so in scala. We will use an example of
building out a simple web stack using reader, writer and state. The
code demonstrated is based closely on a tried and tested purely
functional web stack currently in production.

For appropriate buzz-word compliance during this talk you will see
scalaz, monads, monad transformers, data types, type classes and laws.
