This talk is about building intuition.

We are going to cover a huge amount of content.

But, we are going to do it in little tiny chunks.

You may not understand it all. In fact given the breadth of what we
are going to cover, it is likely you will either be "i know this
stuff" bored in the first half of the talk, or "oh my god, what is he
talking about" in the second half of the talk. This is a good thing
don't fear it.

Again, this talk is just about building intuition.

The idea is it should help you take the next steps to recognizing and
applying these techniques. My hope would be that after this, the next
monad monalogue, or transformer tutorial you face will be just "oh yeah
whatever, it is just organizing code (hopefully in a way that makes it
more likely to be correct and easier to understand).
